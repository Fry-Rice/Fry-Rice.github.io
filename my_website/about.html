    <p>Hi, welcome to the About Page! My name is Michael Mapula and this place is where you can learn more about me. Also, this is not what I look like in real life if you didn't know.</p>
    <p>Here's a bunch of pictures of characters I like from different types of media. But it's just mostly random anime faces lol.</p>

	<p>That's enough images (for now). I'll actually talk about myself now lol, I love to play video games, listen to songs I like and watch anime. One of my favorite video games is Xenoblade Chronicles 2, my favorite artist to listen to is Rynx and one of my favorite anime to watch (also favorite manga to read) is called The Quintessential Quintuplets.</p>
